# Proxy-Reliability-using-Proxybroker2
Python Scripts are developed to create a dynamic data structure for managing open-source proxy servers using the Python module proxybroker2.
These scripts evaluate the proxy servers concurrently using asyncio, collecting data such as successful TCP-Handshake rate, average response time, average transmission time,  average throughput and perform a request. 
The goal is to evaluate a dynamic proxy list for reliable proxy connections.
