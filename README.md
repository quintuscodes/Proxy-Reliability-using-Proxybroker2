# Proxy-Reliability-using-Proxybroker2
Python Scripts for developing a dynamic data structure to manage open source Proxy Servers using a python module proxybroker2 and evaluate them concurrently using asyncio and collect data like successful TCP-Handshake rate, average response time, -transmission time, -throughput and a request. Goal is to evaluate a dynamic Proxy List for reliable Proxy-Connections.
