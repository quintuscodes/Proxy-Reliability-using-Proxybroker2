# Proxy-Reliability-using-Proxybroker2
Python Scripts for developing a dynamic data structure to manage open source Proxy Servers using a python tool proxybroker2 and evaluate evaluate them individually via successful TCP-Handshake rate(Availability), average response time, transmission time(1000Bytes), and throughput(10 Packets รก 1000 Bytes).
    Goal is to evaluate a dynamic Proxy List for reliable Proxy-Connections.
